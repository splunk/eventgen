## The Configuration File ##

The primary source of configuration done in Eventgen is governed by the `eventgen.conf` file. 

* If deployed using containers, Eventgen will look for eventgen.conf in bundles under the `default` directory. For instance, if your bundle is named "datamix-app", you should archive your eventgen.conf in "datamix-app/default/eventgen.conf".
* If deployed as a Splunk App, Eventgen will look for eventgen.conf files for every app installed in Splunk, and will generate events for every eventgen.conf file it finds. This is convenient if you want to design event generation into a Technology Addon (TA) or other type of Splunk app. You can ship Eventgen configurations with your app and distribute the Eventgen app separately.

The INI format of eventgen.conf can have one or more stanzas. Each stanza name is a sample file it will be reading from. There a number of options available in each stanza. For instance, breaking down this tutorial file option-by-option, we can see how this file will be used to set up Eventgen:

```
    [sample.tutorial1]
    mode = replay
    sampletype = csv
    timeMultiple = 2
    backfill = -15m
    backfillSearch = index=main sourcetype=splunkd

    outputMode = splunkstream
    splunkHost = localhost
    splunkUser = admin
    splunkPass = changeme

    token.0.token = \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2},\d{3}
    token.0.replacementType = timestamp
    token.0.replacement = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,%f
```

```
    [sample.tutorial1]
```
This is the stanza name and the name of the sample file in Eventgen or your bundle that you want to read from. You can also specify a regex here to match multiple files of similar extensions/naming conventions.

```
    mode = replay
```
Specify replay mode. This will leak out events at the same timing as they appear in the file (with intervals between events like they occurred in the source file). Default mode is sample, so this is required for replay mode.

```
    sampletype = csv
```
Specify that the input file is in CSV format, rather than a plain text file. With CSV input, we'll look for index, host, source, and sourcetype on a per event basis rather than setting them for the file as a whole.

```
    timeMultiple = 2
```
This will slow down the replay by a factor of 2 by multiplying all time intervals between events by 2.

```
    backfill = -15m
```
Eventgen will startup and immediately fill in the last 15 minutes worth of events from this file. This is in Splunk relative time notation, and can be any valid relative time specifier (**NOTE:** the longer you set this, the longer it will take to get started).

```
    backfillSearch = index=main sourcetype=splunkd
```
A search to run to find the last events generated for this stanza. If this returns any results inside the backfill time window, eventgen will shorten the time window to start at the time of the last event it saw (**NOTE:** this only works with outputMode=splunkstream)

```
    outputMode = splunkstream
```
There are various outputModes available (see the [spec](REFERENCE.md#eventgenconfspec)). The splunkstream mode will output via the Splunk [receivers/stream](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTAPI/RESTinput#receivers.2Fstream) endpoint straight into Splunk. This allows us to specify things like index, host, source and sourcetype to Splunk at index time. In this case, we're getting those values directly from our sample rather than specifying them here in eventgen.conf.

```
    splunkHost = localhost
    splunkUser = admin
    splunkPass = changeme
```
Parameters for setting up outputMode = splunkstream. This is only required if we want to run Eventgen outside of Splunk. As a Splunk App and running as a scripted input, eventgen will gather this information from Splunk itself. Since we'll be running this from the command line for the tutorial, please customize your username and password in the tutorial.

```
    token.0.token = \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} \d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2},\d{3}
    token.0.replacementType = replaytimestamp
    token.0.replacement = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,%f
```
All sets of token replacement lines will look very similar, with different regular expressions and strptime formats. This is a replaytimestamp replacement, which will find the timestamp specified by the regular expression and replace it with a current (or relative to the first event) time based on the stprtime format. Generally you'll define a regular expression and a strptime format to match.
For more information see [regular expressions](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=regex) and [striptime](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=strptime). You can also read more about the different replacement types on the [reference page](REFERENCE.md#eventgenconfspec).

That's it, pretty simple!

## The Sample File ##

Sample files are seed files that Eventgen uses to send data. When a sample file matches the stanza in an eventgen.conf, it uses those configuration options to write data, using that sample file as a template. This flexible format lets you take real sample logs from anywhere and use it to replay/continuously feed data of the same variety. The use of tokens or regexes allow for dynamically-updated data, which is crucial for mimicking the latest timestamps or meeting specific cardinalities for fields.

When creating a bundle for Eventgen, you can have an unlimited number of sample files. Place all the sample files in `bundle/samples/` in order to get properly picked up by Eventgen during run-time.

Here are some examples of what sample files can look like:

```
# sample.tutorial1 -- CSV format
index,host,source,sourcetype,"_raw"
"main","csharp-mbp15.local","/Applications/splunk/var/log/splunk/metrics.log",splunkd,"09-15-2012 22:22:18.226 INFO  Metrics - group=mpool, max_used_interval=11259, max_used=95646, avg_rsv=251, capacity=268435456, used=0"

```

## Use Jinja Templates with Eventgen

Traditionally, Eventgen sample files have been a collection of real logs that are used to replicate the data.
We added support for Jinja templates so that users can dynamically generate a sample file using a well-known and easy-to-learn Jinja module.
In addition to Jinja's ease of use, Jinja templates can include or inherit other templates so that users have freedom to stack different templates.

Simple conf file and Jinja template look like:

{% raw %}
```
# Conf File
[Test_Jinja]
end = 1
count = 1
generator = jinja
jinja_template_dir = templates
jinja_target_template = test_jinja.template
jinja_variables = {"large_number":50000}
earliest = -3s
latest = now
outputMode = stdout


# Jinja Template (file test_jinja.template)
{% for _ in range(0, large_number) %}
{%- time_now -%}
        {"_time":"{{ time_now_epoch }}", "_raw":"{{ time_now_formatted }}  I like little windbags
        Im at: {{ loop.index }} out of: {{ large_number }}
        I'm also hungry, can I have a pizza?"}
{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

Running Eventgen with above conf file and template would result in below output.
```
2018-03-23T14:48:19  I like little windbags
        Im at: 0 out of: 50000
        I'm also hungry, can I have a pizza?
2018-03-23T14:48:19  I like little windbags
        Im at: 1 out of: 50000
        I'm also hungry, can I have a pizza?
2018-03-23T14:48:19  I like little windbags
        Im at: 2 out of: 50000
        I'm also hungry, can I have a pizza?
... and so on with the loop count
```
With above template, Eventgen iterates through a loop of 50000 and generate the data according to the template.
Note that the template is in a JSON format with a key "_raw" which is a raw string of data. It is necessary that you follow this pattern for Eventgen Jinja generator to work.

> If you are using `SA-Eventgen` app rather than PyPi module, put `eventgen.conf` and template files into a directory structure as outlined in the [configuration](CONFIGURE.md).
Default templates folder is `<bundle/samples/templates>`. You can also config absolute or relative path(relative to `eventgen.conf`) via `jinja_template_dir`.

Let's look at how to extend an existing template.

{% raw %}
```
{%- block head -%}
    {% include "another_jinja.template" %}
{%- endblock -%}
```
{% endraw %}

Adding above block imports the contents of another_jinja.template into your current template. You can include many templates.


{% raw %}
```
# extends block inherits a specified template
{% extends "super_jinja.template" %}
```
{% endraw %}

Adding above block makes your current template inherit the contents of super_jinja.template. You can only inherit from a single template.

Also, with Jinja templates, users can define mini functions (macro) inside of the template.

For example, using macro block allows you to define a function that is reusable in your template.

{% raw %}
```
{% macro input(name) -%}
    name = {{[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]|random}}
{%- endmacro -%}
```
{% endraw %}

Using macros will make your template reusable and easy to read.

These are a fraction of examples how flexible and dynamic Jinja module is. For more information about Jinja, see [Jinja2 Documentation](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.10/).

## Interact with RESTful Eventgen

Eventgen comes with server and controller architecture. This means easier scalability and control over multiple Eventgen instances.
For example, in the past, interacting with three Eventgen instances required a user to manually configure each instance and start.
Now, you only need to communicate with the controller to configure these Eventgen instances as long as they are all correctly connected to the messaging queue.
Please note Getting Started section for installation reference.

There is an [Eventgen API Reference](REFERENCE.html#rest-api-reference) that you can also reference.

## For Orca Users: Running Eventgen with Orca ##

Orca 0.8.4 and above will natively support Eventgen 6.0.0 and above versions.

```
# The following command creates a specified number of eventgen instances as well as auto-configuring all servers and controllers.
orca create --egx <NUM>
```

In addition, you can configure a custom scenario for automatic bundle install.

```
# Paste this into your ~/.orca/orca.conf
# Below scenario will download an app from a specified path and start pumping out data
[egxtest]
indexers = 3
search_heads = 2
eventgenx_instances = 1
ansible_params = eventgen_app=<APP_TGZ_PATH>,eventgen_volume=50,eventgen_start=now

# Simply run this Orca command
orca create --sc egxtest
```
