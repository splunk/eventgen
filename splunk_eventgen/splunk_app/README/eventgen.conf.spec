[<sample file name>]
    * This stanza defines a given sample file contained within the samples directory.
    * This stanza can be specified as a PCRE.
    * Hardcoded to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app>/samples/<sample file name>.
    * This stanza is only valid for the following replacementType -> replacement values:
        * static -> <string>
        * timestamp -> <strptime>
        * replaytimestamp -> <strptime>
        * random -> ipv4
        * random -> ipv6
        * random -> mac
        * random -> integer[<start>:<end>]

        * file -> <replacment file name>
        * mvfile -> <replacement file name, expects CSV file>:<column number>

disabled = true | false
    * Like what it looks like.  Will disable event generation for this sample.

sampleDir = <dir>
    * Set a different directory to look for samples in.
    * if sampleDir is not set, by default, eventgen will loads the sample files from <conf_file_dir>/../samples. conf_file_dir is the directory where eventgen conf file locates.
    * You can set sampleDir to some relative path or some absolute path.
    * When sampleDir is an absolute path, eventgen will load the sample files from the path directly. But absolute path is not recommended, absolute path makes your configuration not work with different OS.
    * When sampleDir is a relative path, eventgen takes conf_file_dir as the base path when resolve sampleDir. For example, sampleDir=../../my_sample will be resolved to <conf_file_dir>/../../my_sample. conf_file_dir is the directory where eventgen conf file locates.

threading = thread | process
    * Configurable threading model.  Process uses multiprocessing.Process in Python to get around issues with the GIL.
    * Defaults to thread

profiler = true | false
    * Run eventgen with python profiler on
    * Defaults to false

useOutputQueue = true | false
    * Disable the use of the output Queue.  The output queue functions as a reduce step when you need to maintain a single thread or a limited number of threads outputting data, for instance if you're outputting to a file or to stdout/modular input.  Defaults to true.  If you can multithread output, for example with splunkstream or s2s type outputs, setting this to false will give an order of magnitude or better performance improvement.

###############################
## EVENT GENERATION SETTINGS ##
###############################

generator = default | <plugin>
    * Specifies the generator plugin to use.  Default generator will give behavior of eventgen pre-3.0
      which exclusively uses settings in eventgen.conf to control behavior.  Generators in 3.0 are now
      pluggable python modules which can be custom code.

generatorWorkers = <number of generator threads>
    * Specifies how many threads to use to generate events
    * Defaults to 1

rater = config | <plugin>
    * Specifies which rater plugin to use.  Default rater uses hourOfDayRate, etc, settings to specify
      how to affect the count of events being generated.  Raters in 3.0 are now pluggable python modules.

mode = sample | replay
    * Default is sample, which will generate count (+/- rating) events every configured interval
    * Replay will instead read the file and leak out events, replacing timestamps,

sampletype = raw | csv
    * Raw are raw events (default)
    * CSV are from an outputcsv or export from Splunk.
      CSV allows you to override output fields for the sample like host, index, source and sourcetype
      from the CSV file.  Will read the raw events from a field called _raw.  Assumes the CSV file has
      a header row which defines field names.
      OVERRIDES FOR DEFAULT FIELDS WILL ONLY WITH WITH outputMode SPLUNKSTREAM.

interval = <integer>
    * Only valid in mode = sample
    * How often to generate sample (in seconds).
    * 0 means disabled.
    * Defaults to 60 seconds.

delay = <integer>
    * Specifies how long to wait until we begin generating events for this sample
    * Primarily this is used so we can stagger sets of samples which similar but slightly different data
    * Defaults to 0 which is disabled.

autotimestamp = <boolean>
    * Will enable autotimestamp feature which detects most common forms of timestamps in your samples with no configuration.

timeMultiple = <float>
    * Only valid in mode = replay
    * Will slow down the replay of events by <float> factor.  For example, allows a 10 minute sample
      to play out over 20 minutes with a timeMultiple of 2, or 60 minutes with a timeMultiple of 6.
      By the converse, make timeMultiple 0.5 will make the events run twice as fast.

timeField = <field name>
    * Only valid in mode = replay
    * Will select the field to find the timestamp in.  In many cases, time will come from a different
      field in the CSV.

timezone = local | <integer>
    * If set to 'local', will output local time, if set to '0000' will output UTC time
    * Otherwise it must be a timezone offset like +hhmm or -hhmm, for example:
      US Eastern Standard (EST) would be: timezone = -0500
      US Pacific Daylight (PDT) would be: timezone = -0700
      Indian Standard would be timezone = +0530
    * Valid range +2359 to -2359 (The last two digits are MINUTES, so they should be within 0-59)

backfill = <time-str>
    * Specified in Splunk's relative time language, used to set a time to backfill events

end = <time-str> | <integer>
    * Will end execution on a specific time or a number of events
    * Can be used to execute only a specified number of intervals or with backfill to generate events over a specific time window.

backfillSearch = <splunk search>
    * If outputMode = splunkstream, this will run this search, appending '| head 1', and narrow the
      backfill range specified with backfill to when the search has last seen events.

backfillSearchUrl = <url>
    * Defaults to splunkMethod://splunkHost:splunkPort/, can override in case you're running
      in a cluster.

count = <integer>
    * Maximum number of events to generate per sample file
    * 0 means replay the entire sample.
    * Defaults to 0.

perDayVolume = <float>
    * This is used in place of count.  The perDayVolume is a size supplied in GB per Day.  This value will allow
    * eventgen to supply a target datavolume instead of a count for event generation.
    * Defaults to Null

bundlelines = true | false
    * For outside use cases where you need to take all the lines in a sample file and pretend they are
      one event, but count = 0 will not work because you want to replay all the lines more than once.
      Also, please note you can also use breaker=\r*\n\r*\n to break the sample file into multi-line
      transactions that would work better than this as well.  This is also useful where you want to bring
      in sampletype = csv and bundle that multiple times.
    * If bundlelines = true and the token replacementType is replaytimestamp, we will introduce some randomness
      into the times between items in the transaction in microseconds.
    * Will override any breaker setting.

hourOfDayRate = <json>
    * Takes a JSON hash of 24 hours with float values to rate limit how many events we should see
      in a given hour.
    * Sample JSON:
      { "0": 0.05, "1": 0.05: "2": 0.07... }
    * If a match is not found, will default to count events
    * Also multiplied times dayOfWeekRate, minuteOfHourRate, dayOfMonthRate, monthOfYearRate

dayOfWeekRate = <json>
    * Takes a JSON hash of 7 days of the week in Splunk format (0 is Sunday)
    * Sample JSON:
      { "0": 0.55, "1": 0.97, "2": 0.95, "3": 0.90, "4": 0.97, "5": 1.0, "6": 0.99 }
    * If a match is not found, will default to count events
    * Also multiplied times hourOfDayRate, minuteOfHourRate, dayOfMonthRate, monthOfYearRate

minuteOfHourRate = <json>
    * Takes a JSON hash of 60 minutes of an hour, starting with 0
    * Sample JSON:
      { "0": 1, "2": 1...}
    * If a match is not found, will default to count events
    * Also multiplied times dayOfWeekRate, hourOfDateRate, dayOfMonthRate, monthOfYearRate

dayOfMonthRate = <json>
    * Takes a JSON hash of 31 days of the month, starting with 1
    * Sample JSON:
      { "1": 1, "2": 1...}
    * If a match is not found, will default to count events
    * Also multiplied times dayOfWeekRate, hourOfDateRate, minuteOfHourRate, monthOfYearRate

monthOfYearRate = <json>
    * Takes a JSON hash of 60 minutes of an hour, starting with 0
    * Sample JSON:
      { "0": 1, "2": 1...}
    * If a match is not found, will default to count events
    * Also multiplied times dayOfWeekRate, hourOfDateRate, minuteOfHourRate, dayOfMonthRate

randomizeCount = <float>
    * Will randomize the number of events generated by percentage passed
    * Example values: 0.2, 0.5
    * Recommend passing 0.2 to give 20% randomization either way (plus or minus)

randomizeEvents = <boolean>
    * Will randomize the events found in the sample file before choosing the events.
    * NOT SUPPORTED WITH sampletype csv
    * NOT SUPPORTED WITH mode = replay OR custom generators like generator = replay

breaker = <regular expression>
    * NOT to be confused w/ props.conf LINE_BREAKER.
    * PCRE used for flow control.
    * If count > 0; data will be generated until number of discovered breakers <= "count".
    * If breaker does not match in sample, one iteration of sample will be generated.
    * Defaults to [^\r\n\s]+

earliest = <time-str>
    * Specifies the earliest random time for generated events.
    * If this value is an absolute time, use the dispatch.time_format to format the value.
    * Defaults to now.

latest = <time-str>
    * Specifies the latest random time for generated events.
    * If this value is an absolute time, use the dispatch.time_format to format the value.
    * Defaults to now.

#############################
## JINJA TEMPLATE SETTINGS ##
#############################

jinja_template_dir = <str>
    * directory where jinja templates can be located.
    * If it is not defined, default template directory is <sampleDir>/templates. sampleDir is the parameter which defines the sample file directory.
    * You can set it as some relative path or absolute path.
    * When it is set as the absolute path, eventgen loads the jinja template from this directory directly.
    * When it is set as the relative path, eventgen uses sampleDir as the base when resolving the path. sampleDir is the parameter which defines the sample file directory. For example, if jinja_template_dir=../my_templates, it will be resolved to <sampleDir>/../my_templates.

jinja_target_template = <str>
    * root template to load for all sample generation.

jinja_variables = <json>
    * json value that contains a dict of kv pairs to pass as options to load inside of the jinja templating engine.

################################
## TOKEN REPLACEMENT SETTINGS ##
################################

token.<n>.token = <regular expression>
    * 'n' is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1.
    * PCRE expression used to identify segment for replacement.
    * If one or more capture groups are present the replacement will be performed on group 1.
    * Defaults to None.

token.<n>.replacementType = static | timestamp | replaytimestamp | random | rated | file | mvfile | integerid
    * 'n' is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1. Stop looking at the filter when 'n' breaks.
    * For static, the token will be replaced with the value specified in the replacement setting.
    * For timestamp, the token will be replaced with the strptime specified in the replacement setting
    * For replaytimestamp, the token will be replaced with the strptime specified in the replacement setting
      but the time will not be based on earliest and latest, but will instead be replaced by looking at the
      offset of the timestamp in the current event versus the first event, and then adding that time difference
      to the timestamp when we started processing the sample.  This allows for replaying events with a
      new timestamp but to look much like the original transaction.  Assumes replacement value is the same
      strptime format as the original token we're replacing, otherwise it will fail.  First timestamp will
      be the value of earliest.  NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH REPLAY MODE.  Replay mode replays a whole file
      with timing to look like the original file.  This will allow a single transaction to be replayed with some randomness.
    * For random, the token will be replaced with a type aware value (i.e. valid IPv4 Address).
    * For rated, the token will be replaced with a subset of random types (float, integer), which are
      rated by hourOfDayRate and dayOfWeekRate.
    * For file, the token will be replaced with a random value retrieved from a file specified in the replacement setting.
    * For mvfile, the token will be replaced with a random value of a column retrieved from a file specified in the replacement setting.  Multiple files can reference the same source file and receive different columns from the same random line.
    * For integerid, will use an incrementing integer as the replacement.
    * Defaults to None.

token.<n>.replacement = <string> | <strptime> | ["list","of","strptime"] | guid | ipv4 | ipv6 | mac | integer[<start>:<end>] | float[<start>:<end>] | string(<i>) | hex(<i>) | list["list", "of", "values"] | <replacement file name> | <replacement file name>:<column number> | <integer>
    * 'n' is a number starting at 0, and increasing by 1. Stop looking at the filter when 'n' breaks.
    * For <string>, the token will be replaced with the value specified.
    * For <strptime>, a strptime formatted string to replace the timestamp with
    * For ["list","of","strptime"], only used with replaytimestamp, a JSON formatted list of strptime
      formats to try.  Will find the replace with the same format which matches the replayed timestamp.
    * For guid, the token will be replaced with a random GUID value.
    * For ipv4, the token will be replaced with a random valid IPv4 Address (i.e. 10.10.200.1).
    * For ipv6, the token will be replaced with a random valid IPv6 Address (i.e. c436:4a57:5dea:1035:7194:eebb:a210:6361).
    * For mac, the token will be replaced with a random valid MAC Address (i.e. 6e:0c:51:c6:c6:3a).
    * For integer[<start>:<end>], the token will be replaced with a random integer between
      start and end values where <start> is a number greater than 0
      and <end> is a number greater than 0 and greater than or equal to <start>.  If rated,
      will be multiplied times hourOfDayRate and dayOfWeekRate.
    * For float[<start>:<end>], the token will be replaced with a random float between
      start and end values where <start> is a number greater than 0
      and <end> is a number greater than 0 and greater than or equal to <start>.
      For floating point numbers, precision will be based off the precision specified
      in <start>.  For example, if we specify 1.0, precision will be one digit, if we specify
      1.0000, precision will be four digits. If rated, will be multiplied times hourOfDayRate and dayOfWeekRate.
    * For string(<i>), the token will be replaced with i number(s) of ASCII characters where 'i' is a number greater than 0.
    * For hex(<i>), the token will be replaced with i number of Hexadecimal characters [0-9A-F] where 'i' is a number greater than 0.
    * For list, the token will be replaced with a random member of the JSON list provided.
    * For <replacement file name>, the token will be replaced with a random line in the replacement file.
      * Replacement file name should be a fully qualified path (i.e. $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/windows/samples/users.list).
      * Windows separators should contain double forward slashes '\\' (i.e. $SPLUNK_HOME\\etc\\apps\\windows\\samples\\users.list).
      * Unix separators will work on Windows and vice-versa.
    * Column numbers in mvfile references are indexed at 1, meaning the first column is column 1, not 0.
    * <integer> used as the seed for integerid.
    * Defaults to None.

################################
## HOST REPLACEMENT SETTINGS  ##
################################

host.token = <regular expression>
    * PCRE expression used to identify the host name (or partial name) for replacement.
    * If one or more capture groups are present the replacement will be performed on group 1.
    * Defaults to None.

host.replacement = <replacement file name> | <replacement file name>:<column number>
    * For <replacement file name>, the token will be replaced with a random line in the replacement file.
      * Replacement file name should be a fully qualified path (i.e. $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/windows/samples/users.list).
      * Windows separators should contain double forward slashes '\\' (i.e. $SPLUNK_HOME\\etc\\apps\\windows\\samples\\users.list).
