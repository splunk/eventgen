Description: The logutils package provides a set of handlers for the Python standard
        library's logging package.
        
        Some of these handlers are out-of-scope for the standard library, and
        so they are packaged here. Others are updated versions which have
        appeared in recent Python releases, but are usable with older versions
        of Python and so are packaged here.
