### Intro

The Splunk Event Generator is a utility which allows its user to easily build real-time event generators.
The current maintainers of this project are Brian Bingham (bbingham@splunk.com), Tony Lee (tonyl@splunk.com), and Jack Meixensperger (jackm@splunk.com).

The goals of this project:

* Eliminate the need for hand coded event generators in Splunk apps
* Allow for portability of event generators between applications and allow templates to be quickly adapted between use cases
* Allow every type of event or transaction to be modeled inside Eventgen
